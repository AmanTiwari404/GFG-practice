## Summary
The code snippet is a Java program that calculates the first element of the Fibonacci sequence using matrix exponentiation. It uses a recursive algorithm to calculate the Fibonacci number efficiently.

## Example Usage
```java
Input:
3

Output:
2
```

## Code Analysis
### Inputs
- The code snippet takes an integer `n` as input, which represents the position of the Fibonacci number to be calculated.
___
### Flow
1. The code snippet reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
2. It then enters a loop that runs `t` times.
3. Inside the loop, it reads the value of `n` from the input.
4. An instance of the `Solution` class is created.
5. The `firstElement` method of the `Solution` class is called with `n` as the argument.
6. The `firstElement` method initializes two matrices `A` and `result`.
7. It then enters a loop that runs until `n` becomes 0.
8. If `n` is odd, it multiplies the `result` matrix with the `A` matrix using the `multiplyMatrix` method.
9. It then updates the `A` matrix by multiplying it with itself using the `multiplyMatrix` method.
10. Finally, it divides `n` by 2.
11. The method returns the value of the element at position (1, 0) in the `result` matrix.
___
### Outputs
- The code snippet returns the first element of the Fibonacci sequence at the given position `n`.
